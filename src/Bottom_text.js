                    To start, consider the surface that you will be running on. Roads, tracks and trails all require different types of grip 
                    and cushioning. The type of running that you do and the frequency of your runs will also play a part in choosing your
                     best men’s running shoes. So whether you’re preparing for a marathon, entering running competitions, or are a casual 
                     once-a-week runner, adidas have the ideal running shoes made especially for your needs.

                    Take your current weight into account when selecting the cushioning of your men’s running shoes, as it will affect 
                    the way your feet connect to the ground. And when trying them on, consider going half a size larger as feet generally 
                    expand during any sports activity. Before taking your new men’s running shoes for a spin, it’s important to wear them in for a couple of days.
